# Web Service Usage Example

This solution includes an eclipse project file and may be directly opened there with "File"->"Open Projects from File System..".

It illustrates the usage of a web-service located at [BLZService](http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl).

## Run

In order to run the example use class "RunService.java" which contains the main method.

## Java Class generation

The service code in package/directory *com.thomas_bayer.blz* is generated by calling

```bash
mkdir src bin
wsimport -s src -d bin http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl
```

Where directory *src* is used for the source code and directory *bin* for the binary class files.

## Notes

This example only works till Java 8 "out of the box". For higher versions the JAXB API library needs to be added manually to the build path.
